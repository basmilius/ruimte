//! Refactors: changes of a program that keep what it does. Each is offered where it applies and
//! works out its edits when asked, over the lossless tree, so the comments and the layout of
//! everything it leaves alone survive. The edits can reach other files and move files, and the
//! lines they touch are laid out by the formatter.
