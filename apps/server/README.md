# @ruimte/server

The daemon. It owns terminal sessions and serves them to the UI over one WebSocket. Closing the UI never ends a session; only `session.kill` (or the daemon going down) does.

## Run

```sh
bun run --cwd apps/server start            # ws://127.0.0.1:4210/ws
bun run --cwd apps/server start -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4300
bun run --cwd apps/server dev              # same, restarts on file changes
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Interface to listen on. |
| `--port` | `4210` | Port for `/ws` and `/health`. |

`GET /health` answers `{ ok: true, version }`. Everything else goes over `/ws` using the frames in `packages/contracts`.

## `RUIMTE_HOME`

Where the daemon keeps its state. Defaults to `~/.ruimte`. Layout:

```
$RUIMTE_HOME/
  sessions/            mode 0700
    <sessionId>.txt    serialized screen plus scrollback of one session
```

The file name is the session id passed through `encodeURIComponent`, so an id can never name a path outside `sessions/`.

## Sessions

- A session is keyed by the id the client chooses. `session.create` on an id that is still running answers `session-exists`; on an id whose shell has ended it starts a fresh shell and shows the old screen above a `[session restored, previous shell ended]` line.
- The shell is `$SHELL` (fallback `/bin/zsh` on macOS, `/bin/bash` elsewhere), started as a login shell where the shell takes `-l`, with `TERM=xterm-256color`, `COLORTERM=truecolor` and `RUIMTE_SESSION_ID` set.
- Every session runs a headless xterm in the daemon (10000 lines of scrollback). `session.attach` answers with the serialized screen, after which raw output streams in `session.output` events, coalesced per 16 ms.
- Several clients may attach to one session. Attaching with different `cols`/`rows` resizes the session; the last attacher wins.
- A shell that exits on its own stays in `session.list` as `exited` with its `exitCode` so the last screen can still be read. `session.kill` removes it.

## Snapshots

Every 30 seconds, and on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, the daemon writes each session's screen to `sessions/<sessionId>.txt` (temp file, then rename). When the daemon starts again and a client creates a session with an id that has a snapshot, the first attach shows the snapshot, the restored marker and then the fresh shell. `session.kill` deletes the snapshot on purpose: a killed session should not come back.

## Smoke test

With a daemon running:

```sh
bun run --cwd apps/server smoke            # or: smoke ws://host:port/ws
```

It creates a session, runs `uname`, prints the streamed output and the screen a reattach would receive, then kills the session.
